                    <p>I learned C++, JAVA, and Object-Oriented Programming at Montgomery College.</p>
                    <p>And then I was introduced HTML, CSS, and JS at the University of Maryland at College Park.</p>

                    <p>To further improve my skill, I stared learning <span class="red">Vue.js</span>, which I will be using it for the summer internship if I get accepted.</p>

                    <p>Also, I will love to work for URBN since I love its brands - Urban Outfitters, Free People, and Anthropologie.</p>
                    <p>I am so excited that I discovered that URBN has the summer internship every year, and there is an open position for web developers.</p>
