## Overview

### The challenge

### What I learned

- I learned how to display different page when a button is clicked.
- I learned forEach will save its element in an array
- I learned that for the future project involving submitting a rate or score and display it, use button instead of input.

### Continued development

- I will continue to find a way to prevent a submission if any of the rating buttons were clicked.
