## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that make mobile version first, then make desktop version later will be easier for me to build a website compatible to both mobile and desktop.
I also learned analyzing the contents in a whole page will speed up the coding process. 

### Continued development

- I want to spend less time on creating this kind of simple webpages.
- I will analyze the overall structure of webpage first, and code.
- I need to consider making <div> containers that are easily compatible for mobile and desktop use.
