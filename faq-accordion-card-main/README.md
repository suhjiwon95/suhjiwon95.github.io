## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Set the common design for all screen sizes first, and then set the specific designs for the specific screen sizes using media query.
2. Dropdown items (accordion) can be achieved by using `details` and `summary`. 
  - To giving a CSS effect when the accordion is open, use `details[open] .selector` to set the specific design to that selector.


### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Accordion with HTML elements "details" and "summary"](https://www.imarketinx.de/artikel/html-accordion-details-and-summary.html) - This helped me for learning `details` and `summary` HTML elements. The accordion will be created without JavaScript.
